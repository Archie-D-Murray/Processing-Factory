### Game Flow:

1. **Preparation Phase:**
    
    - **Briefing:** Players are briefed on the spaceship components required for the current level (e.g., thrusters, wings, control panels).
    - **Component Selection:** Players choose from available components and tools for the assembly process, setting up their workspace for efficiency.
2. **Assembly Phase:**
    
    - **Conveyor Belt Activation:** The conveyor belt starts moving, bringing base objects (unassembled spaceship parts) within reach.
    - **Component Addition:**
        - **Drag-and-Drop Mechanics:** Players drag components from their inventory onto the base object on the conveyor belt.
        - **Precision Placement:** Components need to be placed accurately, ensuring correct alignment and orientation.
        - **Tool Usage:** Specific tools may be needed to attach components, such as welders, screwdrivers, or soldering irons.
    - **Real-Time Adjustments:** Players may need to adjust the speed of the conveyor belt or reorganize their workspace on-the-fly to keep up with the assembly pace.
3. **Quality Check:**
    
    - **Inspection Station:** Assembled parts pass through an inspection station where they are evaluated for quality.
    - **Feedback:** Immediate feedback is given on assembly quality, with points awarded for accuracy and completeness.
4. **Challenges and Obstacles:**
    
    - **Time Limits:** Each assembly phase has a time limit, encouraging efficient work.
    - **Increasing Complexity:** As players progress, spaceship components become more complex, requiring more intricate assembly work.
    - **Random Events:** Occasionally, random events (e.g., component shortages, tool malfunctions) occur, adding unpredictability and requiring quick problem-solving.
5. **Progression:**
    
    - **Level Advancement:** Successfully assembling a set number of components allows players to progress to the next level, introducing new spaceship parts and advanced technology.
    - **Upgrades:** Points earned from successful assemblies can be used to upgrade tools, buy better components, or improve the conveyor belt and workspace efficiency.
6. **End-of-Level Evaluation:**
    
    - **Score Summary:** At the end of each level, players receive a summary of their performance, including total points, number of components assembled, and quality ratings.
    - **Rewards:** High scores may unlock special rewards, such as rare components or new tools.
