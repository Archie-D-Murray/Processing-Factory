## Project:
This project was a submission for a first year university assignment focused on teaching the basics of
programming using the [Processing 4.0](https://processing.org) library, I then adapted the project from a processing
project into proper Java so I could use it with a proper IDE.

The brief for the project was a 2D product assembly line game which had a series of requirements that had to be
met such as allowing for mouse input, both frame-based animations and just using rotations and other things.
